Hello Everyone!!
Today I am going to tell you how to make Eggless Chocolate Lava cake
So Let's Start
The ingridients we require are:

 1/2 cup maida 
 1/2 cup powdered sugar or peesi hui chini
 1/4 cup cocoa powder(unsweetened)
 1/4 cup vegetable oil or butter(you can also use ghee instead of butter if you want.Do not use cooking oil instead of vegetable oil)
 1 tsp(teaspoon) vanilla essence or vanilla extract
 1/2 tsp baking powder
 1/4 tsp baking soda
 pinch of salt
 5-10 chocolate pieces (Use dark or milk compound but if you dont have it you can use siple chocolates like dairy milk)
 3/4 cup milk(at room temperature)
 4 small cups(aluminium cups)
 if you dont have aluminium cups you can make them with aluminium foil paper by giving it a cup shape by keeping it at the bottom of any cup or glass.Many videos are there on internet so if you need help you can see them.
 if you dont have aluminium foil also you can make them in a small cake tin or cupcake moulds or ramekins
